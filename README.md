THE FIXED ITERATION SERIES:
1. Root Finding and Function Analysis
Description:
Analyzes the function 
𝑓(𝑥)=log⁡(𝑥)−1𝑥−1
f(x)=log(x)− x−11
​to find and evaluate roots in intervals [0,1] and [2,3]. Includes plots and analysis to confirm root presence and uniqueness.

3. Fixed Point Iteration Method
Description:
Implements fixed-point iteration to find roots of 
𝑔(𝑥)=𝑒1/(𝑥−1)
g(x)=e 1/(x−1)
 . Includes functions for iteration and error tracking, with results showing convergence behavior.

4. Lipschitz Constant and Convergence Analysis
Description:
Calculates Lipschitz constants for 
𝑔(𝑥)=−𝑒1/(𝑥−1)(𝑥−1)2
g(x)=− (x−1) 2 e 1/(x−1)
 
​to assess convergence in intervals [0,1] and [2,3]. Analyzes function behavior and convergence criteria.

4. Modified Fixed Point Iteration and Lipschitz Analysis
Description:
Uses modified fixed-point iteration and evaluates Lipschitz constants for convergence analysis. Applies these methods to function 
𝐺1(𝑥) and G1 (x) to determine convergence and iteration requirements.
